As the director of Indigenous in AI/ML, I organized the Indigenous in AI/ML workshop at Neurips and head the affinitty group of the same name. We brought Indigenous researchers in AI/ML together to learn from one another and experience the broader conference. I also presented on learned representations of geospatial data.
