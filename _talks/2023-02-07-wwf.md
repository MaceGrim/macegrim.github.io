A tag-team presentation with my good friend Michael Running Wolf. We made the case that Indigenous AI is really all about &quot;landscape and language&quot;. Indigenous people&apos;s are protecting ~80% of the Earth&apos;s biodiversity while making up <5% of it&apos;s population (National Geographic), and advanced analytics can help with that monumental task. Additionally, we need more practitioners and researchers in our communities to tackle the problems that we find most urgent and valuable.
