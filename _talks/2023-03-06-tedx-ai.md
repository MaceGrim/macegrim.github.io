Our Indigenous communities have so much to gain from AI, but we don&apos;t have our own practitioners. We need to inspire our youth to reach for these careers, capture the economic value of high-paying data science jobs, and apply these techniques to urgent problems facing Indian country. To do that, we need more Indigenous data scientists. Our solution, the Lakota AI Code Camp, brings Lakota youth to an intensive summer camp to learn more about themselves and these rewarding technical fields.
