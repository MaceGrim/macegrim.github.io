Welcome, my relative! My name is Mason Grimshaw. I'm a husband, father of 3, and a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe (Sicangu Lakota).

At the core of my work is a belief in the power of community. I hope to inspire Indigenous youth through my work, showing them the transformative impact of technology on both personal growth and cultural preservation. Through our initiatives, we see students' confidence soar as they explore new skills, opening doors to opportunities that allow them to engage with the global economy while preserving their unique cultural heritage through that same technology.

Professionally, I'm:
* A co-founder of the [Lakota AI Code Camp](http://lakota.aicode.camp "Lakota AI Code Camp").
* A data scientist at [Ode Partners](http://ode.partners "Ode Partners") where we create digital products and data solutions for environmental impact.
* The Vice President of IndigiGenius, where we're dedicated to empowering Indigenous communities in computer science and machine learning.
